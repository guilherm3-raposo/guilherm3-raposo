# Hi, I’m @guilherm3-raposo 👋

I'm a Brazilian software developer a bit on the older side, welcome to my repo. I really need to put some stuff here... 🤪

I'm a tech head. Soft, firm, hard, vapor, basically anyware there's tech, I'm there. I like to think I'm a punny guy, but you won't find none of that in my code. Recently I've been falling in love with Python 🐍 and out of love with Vue 🥲, tryna learn C++ and then someday Rust, but professionally I spend my days fixing SQL queries,  making sense of legacy code and fixing those bugs I created last build 🤣

*To be continued...*
